# How do we do this . . .
#
# We have two files - one has state information (recent files, last directory
# opened), the other has user defaults (not sure what exactly would go in here
# yet, but we need something separate from the state file). The state file is
# completely automatically managed, but the defaults file has to support user
# editing, which means that aside from generating an initial file we basically
# have to treat it as read-only.
#
# Since the two files have quite different uses we'll have two classes to
# manage the various contents, each with different models - for the recent
# files history we'll provide some stack-like methods, for the last directory
# we'll have a simple set/get, and for the defaults we'll have simple
# get methods (exactly like the underlying ConfigParser objects).

    # the timestamp (in the history model) or the filename (in the recently
    # seen files model). The recently seen files model would have the key be
    # the filename and the value the timestamp - this makes it easy to update
    # the timestamp and so forth. Since the key is the filename, though, we
    # lose the ability to record multiple openings of the same file.
    #
    # We can emulate the recenly seen files model using the history model, but
    # not vice-versa (as noted, we can only record one entry per filename if we
    # use that model, but we can record lots of entries for a given filename in
    # the history model). Logically that would suggest that we use the history
    # model and then emulate the recent file model on top of that.
